# demochatapp
### a chat app made using java+spring and websocket

used technologies:
 - java 23
 - spring framework
   - spring security
   - spring data mongo
   - spring data redis
   - spring for kafka
 - mongodb
 - redis
 - kafka
 - stompjs
   
no particular reason for these choices aside from wanting to learn something new (kafka could easily be replaced with a less powerful messaging system and SQL is probably a better choice for storing messages than MongoDB)

barely scratched the use cases for mongo, redis and kafka, so I'm still not proficient with them

AI was used to generate frontend page and tests

docker swarm might not be working properly, not sure
